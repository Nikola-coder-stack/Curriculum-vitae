        <h1>More of me</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Nikola Ranđelović and I come from Serbia.
            <br>
            I'am 24 years old and I'am currently studying at Faculty of Mechanical engineering in Niš.
            However my desire to learn and explore new opportunities led me to start frontend development
            ,at first as a hobby but now as a potential job.
            <br>
        <h2>Who am I from?</h2>
            I'am originaly from Zaječar ,a small city in the east or south-east part of Serbia.
            <br>
        <h2>Journey</h2>
            My journey first led me to mechanical engineering ,then to BEST (Board of European Students of Technologies)
            where my desire to learn something new and exciting grew to the point of me starting to explore areas such as 
            web design and user experience but then starting to implement those design in web development via Webflow.
            <br>
            Now I have decided to start a new journey ,from scratch and to learn frontend devvelopment from zero to a hundred.
            <br>
            Yes ,I know that is an ambitious goal and in some eyes it may so large that they cant even comprehend it but 
            I also know that i'm now someone who gives up easily.
            <br>
            To the user that might read this I really hope that you to will have such inspiration as myself right now 
            and that someday I can also see your baby steps as you are seeing mine right now.
